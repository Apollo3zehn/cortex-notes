- do not update cortex on every key stroke to not overload the system (throttle but do not miss important changes)
- files copied/deleted from outside vscode are not detected
- what happens on rename?
- loglevel
- does package.json default exclude pattern work? what if user creates file in excluded folder? should be filtered
- org / plaintext files?
- use own icon
- does this make sense or can it be simplified? _cortex.get(getPageName(uri));
- casing ([[Nexus]] vs [[nexus]])
- replace https://svgsilh.com/svg/155655.svg backlinks background image
- how to handle non-existing pages in backlinks view?
- remove hashtag support?? there will be a problem with allowed characters
- when app starts and document is already open but not activated, decorations are missing
- background image should not scroll
- flex column wrap on large screens
- markdown preview highlight links
- create or open journal page command
- insert markdown links more easily (e.g. Teams links, asks for title when pasting it)
- email deep-linking ... preview would be even better
- gitlab/github issues
- toml json schema
- todo view:
